      "answer": "Our package names (Zest, Vibe, Rush, Jynx, Zynix, Kryon) are unique and memorable because we're not like every other company that just slaps 'Enterprise' or 'Pro' on everything. We put thought into our branding and want names that reflect the energy and personality of each package. Other companies use generic names because they're lazy and likely having AI do everything from making their knock-off products to creating their websites - they're just money-grabbing instead of serving clients what they deserve.",
